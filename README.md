# TeachLA Flappy Bird Clone

Welcome! This repository aims to create a <strong> modular</strong> Flappy Bird Clone that is <strong>easily extendable</strong> and <strong>accessible</strong> to use as a tool to inspire others to code. 

## Design Goals

1. The game MUST run without additional software installation.
2. It must be easy to tweak values and add features to give a sense of control and progress (no more than a line of code or two).
3. It must foster engagement with students.

We address our goals as follows:

1. The game is build entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS - no Node installation required
2. Develop a carefully constructed API modeled off of other game libraries as well as exposing constants and additional functionality in a discrete, easy to edit file.
3. It's Flappy Bird! Students are able to play the game that they create.
